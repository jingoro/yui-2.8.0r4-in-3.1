## About

This is a distribution of YUI 2 for YUI 3.1 (2in3) so you can serve the YUI 2
files locally or from your servers instead of YAHOO's CDN.

This will hopefully tidy us over until YAHOO release their official 2in3
distribution.  See <http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=92&t=3223&p=11063>.

## Example

Open the file `example.html` in your browser.
